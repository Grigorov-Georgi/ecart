# ECART - Microservice Web Application
## E-commerce Inventory Management System

## Description:
The application manages the inventory for an e-commerce store. It consists of several microservices that handle different aspects of inventory management.

## Microservices:

- Product Service: Responsible for managing product information, including name, description, price, and availability. It handles CRUD operations for products.

- Order Service: Handles the creation, modification, and cancellation of orders. It interacts with the Product Service to check product availability and updates the inventory accordingly.

- Inventory Service: Tracks the quantity of each product in stock. It receives updates from the Order Service and provides real-time availability information to the Product Service.

- Notification Service: Sends notifications to customers regarding order status updates. It receives events from the Order Service and triggers notifications via email or SMS.

- Analytics Service: Collects and analyzes data related to inventory, product sales, and order history. It provides insights for inventory optimization and decision-making.

## Architecture:

- The microservices communicate with each other through RESTful APIs or asynchronous messaging, depending on the specific requirements.

- Service discovery is implemented using a service registry like Eureka or Consul to allow dynamic discovery and registration of services.

- Load balancing and scaling are implemented to handle increased traffic and ensure high availability. This can be achieved through tools like NGINX or container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

- Each microservice has its own database, and data consistency is maintained through proper transaction management or eventual consistency patterns.

- Security measures, such as authentication and authorization, are implemented to protect the APIs and ensure that only authorized users can access the system.

- Logging and monitoring tools are used to gather metrics, track system health, and identify performance issues. Tools like ELK Stack or Prometheus can be employed for this purpose.

- The application can be deployed on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, or using containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.

- By focusing on the architecture of this e-commerce inventory management system, you can explore various design patterns, scalability options, fault tolerance mechanisms, and integration techniques to gain insights into building robust microservices applications.
